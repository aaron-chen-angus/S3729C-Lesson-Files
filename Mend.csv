Let the lights go down
I'm watching shadows draw lines upon your face
Our feet don't make a sound
"You and me, together, we'll make our great escape"
We'll throw our yesterdays away for tomorrow
I'll trade my tears with yours to drown the sorrow
I'll fight my fear to fight time
If you put your hand in mine
Together we'll mend our hearts again
Let the tides roll by
I'm watching shadows trace the smile upon your face
"It feels so new, watching the sunset in the evening sky"
And the horizon reflectin' blue in your eyes
I'll throw my yesterdays away for tomorrow
I'll trade my tears with yours to drown the sorrow
I'll fight my fear to fight time
If you put your hand in mine
Together we'll mend our hearts again
Together we ran past the places that we left
Letting the waves erase the names we carved into the sand
Together we'll beat the sunrise
"Fight the years, we'll race the tides"
Wind in our hair
I know we'll find our hearts there
We threw our yesterdays away for tomorrow
And I traded my tears with yours to drown the sorrow
"So, I'll fight my fear to fight time"
If you put your hand in mine
Together we'll mend our hearts again
We'll throw our yesterdays away for tomorrow
I'll trade my tears with yours to drown the sorrow
I said I'll fight my fear to fight time
If you put your hand in mine
Together we'll mend our hearts again
Together we'll make it to the day
And we'll find land again
